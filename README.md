# phase-1-Project-Tap-Dance-Dictionary

This is a searchable dictionary of common American Tap Dance movements.

## Description

This dictionary is a (not exhaustive) list of common American Tap Dance movements, meant for tap dance instructors and choreographers to easily reference and search for moves. It can be searched by name of move and by the number of sounds in a move. For instance, a Shuffle would have 2 sounds, as would a Flap!

Use this app to search for move definitions, or as a thesaurus of sorts to find alternative moves with similar sounds! The dictionary is presented with main moves in all capitals, and alternate versions or iterations of that move indented below.

The sidebar "Choreography List" section is available to build your own combinations in the app! Simply click the "+" button next to a move to add it to your combo. To remove a move from your combo, click the "x" button next to that move. You can even drag and drop moves to change the order!

To save your combination, either select your username or create a new username, and then give your combination a name and click "Save". To load previously saved combinations, select one from the "Select a Combination" dropdown menu. You can update saved combinations simply by making changes to the combo, then clicking "Save".

Explore, create, and enjoy!
